# DLH Reproducibility Project Multi-Modality Machine Learning Predicting Parkinson’s Disease

## Summary
Early and accurate detection of Parkinson's disease (PD), before an individual suffers from any symptoms, is essential for effective intervention. The researchers aim at combining machine learning and multi-modal data, to develop better predictive models, and thus contribute to early and correct diagnosis and identification of (potential) high-risk individuals. In addition, the goal of the researchers is to build models based on remotely attainable data, and do not require additional clinic visits to a specialist.

## Orientation 
- The `ReproducibilityStudy.ipynb` file contains our code for the reproducibility study. This is still work in progress as we await access to tier 2 data. 
- The `SummaryofReproducibilityStudy.ipynb` file will summarize our reproducibility study when our project is finished. Hence, this file only consists of a template, but does not contain any content yet.
